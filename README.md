## How to switch levels

As of right now there is no way to click your way to another level. To change levels (only 2 are working) you have to head to game.py and at line

`self.objects, self.background, self.background_image, self.fires = self.level_one.load_level_assets()`

just change `self.level_one.load_level_assets()` to `self.level_two.load_level_assets()` ar restart the game
